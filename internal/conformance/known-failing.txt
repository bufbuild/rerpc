# The current v1.0.0-rc3 of conformance suite wants to see "unknown"
# as the status for Connect unary responses where the JSON error body
# is missing the 'code' property. But we instead want clients to
# synthesize an error code from the HTTP status code. That way, if
# a proxy or middle-box happens to reply with a JSON error, but not
# a valid *Connect* error, we can use the HTTP status to derive an
# error code, just like we do when the response has an unexpected
# content type.
#
# So after we fix the tests in the conformance suite, we can remove
# these lines below.

# The current v1.0.0-rc3 of conformance suite has expectations based
# on the old mappings of HTTP to RPC code. The mappings were revised
# in the spec (https://github.com/connectrpc/connectrpc.com/pull/130),
# and this repo implements those new mappings. So test cases based on
# the old mappings fail for right now.
